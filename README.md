# NetDiff

This is a C# implementation of the O(ND) diff algorithm. It was originally written by skanmera, and the original repository is found at the following link:

https://github.com/skanmera/NetDiff

My fork of the repository is for the sole purpose of converting the original repository to .NET Standard (skanmera's version was built for .NET Framework). With the repository built for .NET Standard, it is much more portable and can target multiple platforms.
